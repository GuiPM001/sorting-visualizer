## ✦ About The Project
The project consists of a screen, which allows you to visualize how different sorting algorithms work.

In addition to displaying the time spent on each sort, it is also possible to control the size of the list, its values and the animation time. This allows for a more detailed view of the sorting process, and you can choose different algorithms, such as Merge Sort and Insertion Sort.
